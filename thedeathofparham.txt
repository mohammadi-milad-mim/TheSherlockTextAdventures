I am his old friend.
I don't like him.
He is a hardworking man.
He is a quite man.
I don't know him.
I don't trust police.
He is a trustworthy man.
Money can make us do anything.
I just know how to cook.
He is realy cold and becomes angry very fast.
He is very close to Parham and he has the keys.
I think there is a reason that he has moved here.
I believe the police.
He is so unprofessional.
We can always trust our old friends.
He is very young.
Why should I have killed him?.
I am his gardener too he is a good man.
His garden is messy.
I never lie to police.
All of us need a good assistant.
We always drink together on fridays but not the last friday.
He was always called the short chef.
I know him very well he has been working for Parham since 10 years ago.
I have been Parham's neighbour for 15 years.
He is the worst neighbour in this street he is killing us with the sound of his house construction everyday.
Police is always late just when the criminal is complete.
He is smart.
He comes to Parham's house almost everyday!
Wow! I didn't know that Parham has a chef.
I don't know him but he seems to be a very kind person.
I hate him he thinks that he owns the whole street and he always parks his car in front of my house.
I am his new neighbour and I dont know him very well.
Just brings peace to this neighbourhood.
I am a fan of you two.
Everything is against him he is the murderer.
He is just a simple chef.
I think the murderer tried to show that the gardener is the murderer.
He seems to be an old friend.
I think he is the murderer.
Always trust the police.
I cant understand what does watson is doing here.
He can be the murderer but his friendship is too deep.
He droped of from CE in University of Isfahan.
The left neighbour says that the gardener has been working here for 10 years.
He knows sahand very well but we can't trust him.
He is new but no reason to be murderer.
Lestrade just makes us slow.
The decision is up to you sherlock.
